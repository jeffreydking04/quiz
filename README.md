# README

# This my quiz app, the seed of my best idea.  It should grow into a monster.
# But we will start small and functional.
# The quiz app simply allows registered users to create and persist their own 
# quizzes.  It then plays the quizzes back to them, letting them answer and grade 
# their responses themselves.  It is meant to be a tool to help organized and 
# committed autodidacts create tools to help them learn more quickly.  It will
# mirror the process I use when learning, but automate much of the review that
# is necessary for me to master new material.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
